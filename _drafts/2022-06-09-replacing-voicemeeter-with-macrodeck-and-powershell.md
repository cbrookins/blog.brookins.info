title: Replacing Voicemeeter with Macrodeck 2 and Powershell

***Voicemeeter is Audio Mixer Application endowed with Virtual Audio Device used as Virtual I/O to mix and manage any audio sources from or to any audio devices or applications.***

[Voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/) was great, for a long time, and worked perfectly most of the time.  The biggest issue I ever had with [Voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/) was having to reset the engine when the audio would break up.  I decided instead of moving my audio through a third party tool, I wanted to work directly with the Windows audio interface.  My next problem was that I leaned on [Macro Buttons](https://forum.vb-audio.com/viewtopic.php?t=353), another application bundled with [Voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/), and VBAN for control of my audio from an Android tablet.  That is where [MacroDeck](https://macrodeck.org/) comes in.
