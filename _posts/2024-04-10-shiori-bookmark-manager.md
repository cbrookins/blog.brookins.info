For years, I relied on the built-in bookmark managers of my web browsers. It was convenient, sure, but it always felt a little...off. My bookmarks were scattered across different browsers, and there was a constant nagging feeling that they weren't truly mine.

What if the service shut down? What if they changed their terms of service and locked me out? The answer: I'd lose all those carefully curated articles, recipes, and research papers.

That's when I started looking for a self-hosted bookmark manager. I wanted something that was private, secure, and completely under my control. After some digging, I stumbled upon [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori), and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer.

### Why Shiori?

**Self-Hosted**: This is the biggest win. My bookmarks are stored on my own server, giving me complete control. 

**Web Extension Support**: There's even a web extension for Firefox and Chrome, allowing you to seamlessly save bookmarks from your browser directly to Shiori.

### Filling the Gap

The only thing it was missing was a  way to bookmark something from my iPhone.

Here is an [iOS shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6742e9e3dd9a44be9ffb78083fa3d168) I threw together.
